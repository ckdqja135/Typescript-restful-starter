### Tables

**Markdown Extra** has a special syntax for tables:

Item     | Value
-------- | ---
Computer | $1600
Phone    | $12
Pipe     | $1

You can specify column alignment with one or two colons:

| Item     | Value | Qty   |
| :------- | ----: | :---: |
| Computer | $1600 |  5    |
| Phone    | $12   |  12   |
| Pipe     | $1    |  234  |

You can also render sequence diagrams like this:

```sequence
Alice->Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
Note right of Bob: Bob thinks
Bob-->Alice: I am good thanks!
```
